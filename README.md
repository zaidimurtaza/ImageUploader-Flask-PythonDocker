## Installation Instructions

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flask-react-app.git
cd flask-react-app
2. Set Up the Backend (Flask)
Without Docker:
Navigate to the backend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required Python dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask app:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The backend should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

With Docker:
Make sure Docker is installed on your machine. If not, follow this guide to install Docker.

Build the Docker image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t flask-react-app-backend .
Run the Docker container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-react-app-backend
The Flask app will be running at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ inside the Docker container.

3. Set Up the Frontend (React)
Without Docker:
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
Install the required npm dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Run the React app:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The React app should now be running at http://localhost:3000/.

With Docker:
Make sure Docker is installed on your machine. If not, follow this guide to install Docker.

Build the Docker image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t flask-react-app-frontend .
Run the Docker container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 3000:3000 flask-react-app-frontend
The React app will be running at http://localhost:3000/ inside the Docker container.

Project Details
Backend: Flask API that handles requests and serves data to the React frontend.
Frontend: A React app that interacts with the Flask API to display data.

Deployment
You can deploy both the Flask backend and React frontend to cloud platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Docker. Here's an example of deploying both apps with Heroku:

Deploying the Flask Backend to Heroku
Install the Heroku CLI.

Login to Heroku:

bash
Copy code
heroku login
Navigate to the backend directory and create a Heroku app:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
heroku create flask-react-backend
Push the code to Heroku:

bash
Copy code
git push heroku master
Open your app:

bash
Copy code
heroku open
Deploying the React Frontend to Heroku
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
Build the React app:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
Create a Heroku app for the frontend:

bash
Copy code
heroku create flask-react-frontend
Push the built frontend to Heroku:

bash
Copy code
git push heroku master
Open your app:

bash
Copy code
heroku open
